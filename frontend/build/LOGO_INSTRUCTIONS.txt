LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

To add your Campus Cravings logo:

1. Place your logo image file in this folder (frontend/public/)
2. Name it: logo.png
3. The logo should feature:
   - "Campus Cravings" text in gothic/old English style
   - German flag element
   - Bowl of fries with cheese illustration

The Navbar component will automatically display the logo once you place it here.

If the logo file is not found, a fallback icon will be displayed.
